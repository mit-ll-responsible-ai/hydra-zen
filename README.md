hydra-zen is a Python library that simplifies the process of writing code (research-grade or production-grade) that is:

- **Configurable**: you can configure all aspects of your code from a single interface (the command line or a single Python function).
- **Repeatable**: each run of your code will be self-documenting; the full configuration of your software is saved alongside your results.
- **Scalable**: launch multiple runs of your software, be it on your local machine or across multiple nodes on a cluster.

It builds off – and is fully compatible with – [Hydra](https://hydra.cc/), a framework for elegantly 
configuring complex applications. 

hydra-zen helps simplify the process of using Hydra by providing 
convenient functions for creating and validating configs, as well as launching Hydra jobs. It also provides novel 
functionality such as wrapped instantiation and meta fields in configs.
    
## Installation
`hydra-zen` is lightweight: its only dependencies are `hydra-core` and `typing-extensions`.

```shell script
pip install hydra-zen
```
