hydra-zen is a Python library that simplifies the process of writing code (research-grade or production-grade) that is:

- **Configurable**: you can configure all aspects of your code from a single interface (the command line or a single Python function).
- **Repeatable**: each run of your code will be self-documenting; the full configuration of your software is saved alongside your results.
- **Scalable**: launch multiple runs of your software, be it on your local machine or across multiple nodes on a cluster.


**hydra-zen eliminates all hand-written yaml configs from your Hydra project**. It does so by providing functions that [dynamically and automatically](https://mit-ll-responsible-ai.github.io/hydra-zen/api_reference.html#creating-and-working-with-configs) generate dataclass-based configs for your code. It also provides a [custom config-store API](https://mit-ll-responsible-ai.github.io/hydra-zen/api_reference.html#storing-configs) and [task-function wrapper](https://mit-ll-responsible-ai.github.io/hydra-zen/generated/hydra_zen.zen.html#hydra_zen.zen), which help to eliminate most of the Hydra-specific boilerplate from your project.
