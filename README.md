hydra-zen is a Python library that simplifies the process of writing code (research-grade or production-grade) that is:

- **Configurable**: you can configure all aspects of your code from the command line (or from a single Python function).
- **Repeatable**: each run of your code will be self-documenting; the full configuration of your software is saved alongside your results.
- **Scalable**: launch multiple runs of your software, be it on your local machine or across multiple nodes on a cluster.

## Installation
`hydra-zen` is lightweight: its only dependencies are `hydra-core` and `typing-extensions`.

```shell script
pip install hydra-zen
```
