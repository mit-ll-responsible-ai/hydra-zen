Installing hydra-zen
====================
hydra-zen is lightweight: its only dependencies are ``hydra-core`` and ``typing-extensions``.
It is available for installation via pip:

.. code-block:: shell

  pip install hydra-zen

We strive to maintain as wide a window of backwards compatibility Hydra (and omegaconf) as possible.
