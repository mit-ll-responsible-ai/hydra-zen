.. admonition:: Prerequisites

   This tutorial does not assume that you have any familiarity with
   hydra-zen or Hydra. It does, however, assume that you are comfortable
   with using Python. If you are new to Python, consider consulting this resource for 
   `getting started with Python <https://www.pythonlikeyoumeanit.com/module_1.html>`_, 
   and this 
   `tutorial on the essentials of Python <https://www.pythonlikeyoumeanit.com/module_2.html>`_.

.. _basic-app:

================================================
Create and Launch a Basic Application with Hydra
================================================

In this tutorial we will create a basic application that we can configure and launch 
using Hydra. Although this project will be trivial, we will be introduced to the 
overarching design that is used for any Hydra-based project, as well to the 
core functionality provided by hydra-zen.


Getting Started
===============

We will install hydra-zen and then we will create a Python script where we will create 
our application.

Installing hydra-zen
--------------------

To install hydra-zen in your Python environment, run the following command in your 
terminal:

.. code:: shell
    
    pip install hydra-zen


To verify that hydra-zen is installed as-expected, open a Python console and try 
importing ``hydra_zen``.


.. code:: pycon
    
    >>> import hydra_zen


Creating a Script for our Application
-------------------------------------

Navigate to (or create) a directory where you are comfortable with files being written; 
running our code will leave behind some "artifacts" here. Create a new text file called
``my_app.py`` and open it in an editor.

Creating a Simple Hydra-Based Application
=========================================

Let's design our program to take in two (configurable) player names, and to log the 
players' names to a text file called ``player_log.txt``.

Our program will consist of two components, which comprises the structure of any 
Hydra-based application:

1. A "config", which defines the configurable interface of our application.
2. A task function, which accepts the populated config, and whose body specifies the code that will be executed when our application is launched.

Once we create this typical Hydra app, we will iterate on it and simplify things by using how hydra-zen's :func:`hydra_zen.zen` wrapper.

Writing the Application
-----------------------

In ``my_app.py`` we'll define a config and task function for this application. We will 
use :func:`~hydra_zen.make_config` to create the config. Write the following code in 
this file.


.. code-block:: python
    :caption: Contents of my_app.py:
    
    from hydra_zen import make_config, instantiate
    
    Config = make_config("player1", "player2")
    
    def task_function(cfg):
        # cfg: Config
        obj = instantiate(cfg)
        
        # access the player names from the config
        p1 = obj.player1
        p2 = obj.player2

        # write the log with the names
        with open("player_log.txt", "w") as f:
            f.write("Game session log:\n")
            f.write(f"Player 1: {p1}\n" f"Player 2: {p2}")

        return p1, p2 

.. _launch-basic-app:

Launching the Application
-------------------------

It's time to run our application. Open a Python console -- or a Jupyter notebook -- in 
the same directory as ``my_app.py``. First, we will import our config and our task 
function.


.. code-block:: pycon
    
    >>> from my_app import Config, task_function

We will also need to import hydra-zen's :func:`~hydra_zen.launch` function.

.. code-block:: pycon
    
    >>> from hydra_zen import launch

Next, we will launch our application by providing the :func:`~hydra_zen.launch` 
function with: our config, our task function, and specific configured values for the 
player's names. Here, we will use the names ``link`` and ``zelda`` for the names of 
player 1 and player 2, respectively. The ``version_base`` parameter controls some of the default behaviors of Hydra [1]_.


.. code-block:: pycon
   :caption: Launching our application

   >>> job = launch(Config, task_function, overrides=["player1=link", "player2=zelda"], version_base="1.1")


Let's inspect the completion status of this job by inspecting ``job.status``; it should
indicate ``COMPLETED``.

.. code:: pycon

   >>> job.status
   <JobStatus.COMPLETED: 1>

We can also directly access the value that is returned by our task-function.

.. code:: pycon

   >>> job.return_value
   ('link', 'zelda')


.. warning::
   If you modify the contents of ``my_app.py``, then you need to restart your Python 
   console (or restart the kernel of your Jupyter notebook) and re-launch the 
   application in order for these changes to take effect.

Inspecting the Results
----------------------

Our application was designed to log the names of the players for that particular game 
session; let's check that this log was written as-expected, and familiarize ourselves 
with the other files that Hydra writes when it launches an application.

First, we'll create a simple Python function that will make it easy to print files 
in our Python console

.. code-block:: pycon

   >>> from pathlib import Path 
   >>> def print_file(x: Path):
   ...     with x.open("r") as f: 
   ...         print(f.read())

By default, Hydra will create a directory called ``outputs``, and will store the 
application's outputs in a time-stamped subdirectory of the form  
``outputs/${now:%Y-%m-%d}/${now:%H-%M-%S}``. The particular subdirectory for our job is 
provided by ``job.working_dir``.

.. code-block:: pycon
   
   >>> job_dir = Path(job.working_dir)  # type: ignore
   >>> job_dir  # output will vary based on reader's date/time/OS
   WindowsPath('outputs/2021-10-21/10-36-23')

The contents of this directory consists of: the log-file that our application wrote, a 
``.hydra`` directory that details the configurations of this particular job, and a 
log-file written by Hydra.

.. code:: pycon
   
   >>> sorted(job_dir.glob("*"))
   [WindowsPath('outputs/2021-10-21/10-36-23/.hydra'),
    WindowsPath('outputs/2021-10-21/10-36-23/player_log.txt'),
    WindowsPath('outputs/2021-10-21/10-36-23/zen_launch.log')]

Let's verify that our application wrote the player-log as-expected.

.. code:: pycon
   
   >>> print_file(job_dir / "player_log.txt")
   Game session log:
   Player 1: link
   Player 2: zelda

Great! The players' names were recorded correctly.

The contents of the ``.hydra`` subdirectory is a collection of YAML files:

.. code:: pycon
   
   >>> sorted((job_dir / ".hydra").glob("*"))
   [WindowsPath('outputs/2021-10-21/10-36-23/.hydra/config.yaml'),
    WindowsPath('outputs/2021-10-21/10-36-23/.hydra/hydra.yaml'),
    WindowsPath('outputs/2021-10-21/10-36-23/.hydra/overrides.yaml')]

To see the particular config that was passed to our task function for this job,
we can inspect ``config.yaml``.

.. code:: pycon
   
   >>> print_file(job_dir / ".hydra" / "config.yaml")
   player1: link
   player2: zelda

We successfully designed, configured, and launched an application using hydra-zen and 
Hydra! In the next tutorial, we will add a command line interface to this app.

In the final section, let's see how we can simplify some of our code using special features provided by hydra-zen.

Simplifying Things with :func:`hydra_zen.zen`
---------------------------------------------

.. note:: This part of the tutorial requires ``hydra-zen v0.9.0`` or later to be installed.

We can simplify our task function, removing Hydra-specific logic from it, by using :func:`hydra_zen.zen`. 

Let's update our task function in `my_app.py` to be a simple function whose signature determines the fields that will be extracted and instantiated from our config.
Then we can use :func:`hydra_zen.builds`, instead of :func:`hydra_zen.make_config`, to generate our config based off of the task function's signature.


.. code-block:: python
   :caption: Simplified contents of my_app.py:
    
   from hydra_zen import builds
   
   # note: type annotations are not required
   def new_task_function(player1: str, player2: str):
       # write the log with the names
       with open("player_log.txt", "w") as f:
           f.write("Game session log:\n")
           f.write(f"Player 1: {player1}\n" f"Player 2: {player2}")

       return player1, player2

   # auto-populates the fields of our configs based on the signature of
   # `task_function`
   Config = builds(new_task_function, populate_full_signature=True)


Wrapping this function as

.. code-block:: python
   :caption: Simplified contents of my_app.py:
    
   from hydra_zen import zen

   hydra_compat_task_fn = zen(task_function)

returns a Hydra-compatible task function, which accepts a single input config just like our original task function did. However, the `zen` wrapper adds the logic of extracting
and instantiating the `player1` and `player2` fields from our config for us.

Now we will supply a zen-wrapped version of our task function to :func:`hydra_zen.launch`; all other aspects of launching our app and inspecting its results are unchanged.

.. code-block:: pycon
   :caption: Launching our application

   >>> from my_app import Config, new_task_function
   >>> from hydra_zen import zen, launch
   >>> wrapped_fn = zen(new_task_function)
   >>> job = launch(Config, wrapped_fn, overrides=["player1=link", "player2=zelda"], version_base="1.1")

See that we were able to launch the same app as before, but with some additional benefits:

- Our task function does not have any Hydra-specific logic and can be used for other purposes.
- We can utilize :func:`hydra_zen.builds` to auto-populate our config instead of hand-specifying the fields.

Reference Documentation
=======================
Want a deeper understanding of how hydra-zen and Hydra work?
The following reference materials are especially relevant to this
tutorial section.

- :func:`~hydra_zen.zen`
- :func:`~hydra_zen.builds`
- :func:`~hydra_zen.make_config`
- :func:`~hydra_zen.launch`
- `Hydra's version_base <https://hydra.cc/docs/upgrades/version_base/#internaldocs-banner>`_


.. attention:: **Cleaning Up**:
   To clean up after this tutorial, delete the ``outputs`` directory that Hydra created 
   upon launching our application. You can find this in the same directory as your 
   ``my_app.py`` file.

Footnotes
=========
.. [1] Specifically, we want to ensure that Hydra will `change its working directory to its "jobdir" <https://hydra.cc/docs/upgrades/1.1_to_1.2/changes_to_job_working_dir/>`_ when we launch our app.
