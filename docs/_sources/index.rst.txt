=====================================
Welcome to hydra-zen's documentation!
=====================================

hydra-zen is a Python library that simplifies the process of writing code (be it research-grade or production-grade) that is:

- **Configurable**: change deeply-nested parameters and swap out entire pieces of your program, all from the command line. 
- **Repeatable**: each run of your code will be self-documenting; the full configuration of your software is saved alongside your results.
- **Scalable**: launch multiple runs of your software, be it on your local machine or across multiple nodes on a cluster.

It builds off -- and is fully compatible with -- `Hydra <https://hydra.cc/>`_, a 
framework for elegantly configuring complex applications. hydra-zen helps simplify the 
process of using Hydra by providing specialized functions for :ref:`creating configs <create-config>` and 
launching Hydra jobs. 


.. admonition:: Attention, Hydra users:

  If you are already use Hydra, let's cut to the chase: **the most important benefit of using hydra-zen is that it automatically and dynamically generates structured configs for you**.
  

  .. code-block:: python
     :caption: Creating a structured config *without hydra-zen*
     
     from dataclasses import dataclass, field
     
     def foo(bar: int, baz: list[str], qux: float = 1.23):
         ...
     
     @dataclass
     class FooConf:
         _target_: str = "__main__.foo"
         bar: int = 2
         baz: list[str] = field(default_factory=lambda: ["abc"])
         qux: float = 1.23


  .. code-block:: python
     :caption: Creating an equivalent structured config *with hydra-zen*

     from hydra_zen import builds

     def foo(bar: int, baz: list[str], qux: float = 1.23):
         ...

     FooConf = builds(foo, bar=2, baz=["abc"], populate_full_signature=True)

  This means that it is much **easier and safer** to write and maintain the configs for your Hydra applications:
  
  - Write all of your configs in Python. No more yaml files!
  - Write less, :ref:`stop repeating yourself <dry>`, and get more out of your configs.
  - Get automatic type-safety via :func:`~hydra_zen.builds`'s signature inspection.
  - :ref:`Validate your configs <builds-validation>` before launching your application.
  
hydra-zen also also provides Hydra users with powerful, novel functionality. With it, we can:

- Add :ref:`enhanced runtime type-checking <runtime-type-checking>` for our Hydra application, via :ref:`pydantic <pydantic-support>`, `beartype <https://github.com/beartype/beartype>`_, and other third-party libraries.
- Design configs with specialized behaviors, like :ref:`partial configs <partial-config>`, or :ref:`configs with meta-fields <meta-field>`. 
- Use :ref:`additional data types <additional-types>` in our configs, like :py:class:`pathlib.Path`, that are not natively supported by Hydra.
- Leverage a powerful :ref:`functionality-injection framework <zen-wrapper>` in our Hydra applications.
- Run static type-checkers on our config-creation code to catch incompatibilities with Hydra.


Installation
============

hydra-zen is lightweight: its only dependencies are ``hydra-core`` and 
``typing-extensions``. To install it, run:

.. code:: console

   $ pip install hydra-zen

If instead you want to try out the features in the upcoming version, you can install 
the latest pre-release of hydra-zen with:

.. code:: console

   $ pip install --pre hydra-zen


Learning About hydra-zen
========================

Our docs are divided into four sections: Tutorials, How-Tos, Explanations, and 
Reference.

If you want to get a bird's-eye view of what hydra-zen is all about, or if you are 
completely new to Hydra, check out our **Tutorials**. For folks who are savvy Hydra 
users, our **How-Tos** and **Reference** materials can help acquaint you with the 
unique capabilities that are offered by hydra-zen. Finally, **Explanations** provide 
readers with taxonomies, design principles, recommendations, and other articles that 
will enrich their understanding of hydra-zen and Hydra.
