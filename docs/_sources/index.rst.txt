=====================================
Welcome to hydra-zen's documentation!
=====================================

hydra-zen is a Python library that simplifies the process of writing code (be it research-grade or production-grade) that is:

- **Configurable**: you can configure all aspects of your code from the command line (or from a single Python function).
- **Repeatable**: each run of your code will be self-documenting; the full configuration of your software is saved alongside your results.
- **Scalable**: launch multiple runs of your software, be it on your local machine or across multiple nodes on a cluster.

It builds off -- and is fully compatible with -- `Hydra <https://hydra.cc/>`_, a 
framework for elegantly configuring complex applications. hydra-zen helps simplify the 
process of using Hydra by providing convenient functions for creating configs and 
launching Hydra jobs. It also provides novel functionality such :ref:`wrapped instantiation <zen-wrapper>` and :ref:`meta fields <meta-field>` in configs.
