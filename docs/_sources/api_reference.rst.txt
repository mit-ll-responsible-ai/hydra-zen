*************************
Launching Jobs with Hydra
*************************

hydra-zen provides users the ability to launch a Hydra job via a 
Python function instead of from a commandline interface.

.. currentmodule:: hydra_zen

.. autosummary::
   :toctree: generated/

   launch

.. currentmodule:: hydra_zen.experimental

.. autosummary::
   :toctree: generated/
   
   hydra_run
   hydra_multirun


*********************************
Creating and Working with Configs
*********************************

hydra-zen provides us with some simple but powerful tools for creating and working with 
configs. Among these, the most essential functions for creating configs are 
:func:`~hydra_zen.make_config` and :func:`~hydra_zen.builds`. Then, 
:func:`~hydra_zen.instantiate` can be used to resolve these configs so that they return 
the data and class-instances that we need for our application.

Working with YAMLs
******************
Hydra serializes all configs to a YAML-format text when launching a job.
The following utilities can be used to work with YAML-serialized configs.

.. currentmodule:: hydra_zen

.. autosummary::
   :toctree: generated/


   to_yaml
   save_as_yaml
   load_from_yaml


*********************
Third-Party Utilities
*********************

.. _data-val:

Runtime Data Validation
***********************

Although Hydra provides some runtime type-checking functionality, it only supports :ref:`a limited set of types and annotations <type-support>`. hydra-zen offers support for more robust runtime type-checking capabilities via various third-party libraries.

.. currentmodule:: hydra_zen.third_party

.. autosummary::
   :toctree: generated/

   beartype.validates_with_beartype
   pydantic.validates_with_pydantic
